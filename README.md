# What is Quantum Game Launcher?
Quantum Game Launcher is a fast and free application to combine all of your games into one central location. It is designed to be the first and final destination for those who are into legal emulation. Those who are experienced and even those who have no experience at all are made to feel at home. No tutorials needed, because the program is the tutorial.

## Current state of the project
We are currently at version 0.3.3 BETA. Development began September 2022. Some features may be noticeably incomplete, but a lot of the core foundation is ready. You can import your games, download metadata for them, and launch them through your emulators. Development is non linear and may seem slow, but that is because we develop to a high standard and focus on unique features.

## Proposed Features

- **Live preview of controller mappings**

Remembering controller mappings when emulating various consoles can certainly be confusing. At any time, press the hotkey to bring up the pause screen and get a live preview of your current controller and the controller of the emulated console, and see how each button or axis is mapped.
